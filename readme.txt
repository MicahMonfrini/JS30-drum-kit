## **Notes**
`document.querySelector()` is used to select elements within the DOM. The `document` interface is used as the entry point to  the DOM. 

`.querySelector()` returns the element that matches the selector. Must be a valid CSS selector string.

The `currentTime` property sets or returns the current position (in seconds) of the audio playback.
